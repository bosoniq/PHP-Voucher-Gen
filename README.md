##PHP Voucher Generator

The PHP Voucher Generator is a simple set of classes based around a strategy design pattern, which allow you to generate voucher values using recoverable information.  
The voucher values can be produced using two types of simple encodings which can be easily expanded as needed.
The generated values may also be outputted in various formats, to the screen, to a CSV document or to a simple text document.  This too can be easily added to depending on requirements.
